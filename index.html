                                Hi, my name is Timmy Klamvik. I consider myself a Data Analyst, Communicator, and a Teacher at heart. I am currently situated in Gothenburg, Sweden, but I am available for remote work in and relocation to any time zone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am currently undertaking an Msc in Communication at the University of Gothenburg, but prior to starting this degree I have:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Completed a bachelors degree in English Linguistics</li>
                                <li>Taken supplementary courses in sociology, psychology and statistics</li>
                                <li>Studied at the University at Albany during an exchange year (3.77 GPA)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                If you are here as a recruiter, please feel free to explore the sections below depending on in what capacity you are interested in me.

                                            <p>
                                                My passion is to communicate data to inspire positive, unbiased, and accurate change. I do this through visualizations, and effective communication. After all, a data analyst is as much a story teller as a numbers person.
                                            <p>
                                                To that end, when it comes to my role as a data analyst: I rely heavily on my background in digital design, and my knowledge of statistics to create effective and accurate visuals that are easy to understand and absorb. 
                                                Furthermore, during my academic studies, while I have a background in linguistics and communication, I have always been drawn to quantitative science, and several academic reports written during my studies can be seen below.

                                            I consider myself an expert communicator in terms of organizational structure, knowledge management, stakeholder management and intercultural management. Thus, my specialty is international organizations that deal with complex cultural structures that are in need of a communicator that can work on solving cultural miscommunication, identify gaps in understanding regarding the existing knowledge within the organization, and provide content that can be absorbed all over the globe.

                                            My academic background regarding intercultural and interpersonal factors is exhaustive. Indeed, I started my education examining sociolinguistics, and has since then moved on to sociology and communication. However, since, as a result of my interest in data and technology, I have a specific focus on digital media. I have experience in keeping content schedules, measuring analytics in order to find weaknesses in the current digital strategy, SEO/SEM content production and many more skills that come with digital communication.

                                            I started my academic career in English linguistics. Since then, I have also gained an understanding of intercultural factors that can make learning English and cultural aspects associated with the language difficult.

                                    In turn, this has helped fuel research into Vitamin-D deficiencies which might be a major factor in COVID-19 hospitalization and death. 
                                    Unfortunately, another worrying development has also followed: With an easy explanation for the disproportionate amounts of 
                                    African-Americans being affected by the virus, it appears as if many Americans have begun disregarding cultural and societal factors that might further amplify 
                                    these death tolls. This article discusses this issue.</p>

                                    Youth Capital is an NGO working hard to decrease youth unemployment in South Africa. As a part of a larger assignment, me and two peers designed a digital content strategy
                                    in order to increase their reach. Using data and insights from the NGO, we suggested a plan that was tailor-made for the South African context where mobile data is expensive and not a given for the NGO's target audience.

                                <p class="summary">This study aims to investigate whether variables such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, neighborhood of residence and previous encounters 
                                    with the police affect the level of trust international students have towards the Swedish police and police in their home country. 
                                    Furthermore, it also examines the discrepancy (or lack thereof) in the confidence that international students have in the Swedish police 
                                    and the police in their home countries. Studies show that confidence in the police is the main attribute for successful communication between officers and civilians,
                                     as well as for compliance and cooperation. To examine this, a quantitative survey was conducted where a total of 104 international students in 
                                     Sweden participated in the survey. The results revealed that gender, victimization experience, and negative encounters with the police harm confidence in the police. 
                                     On the other hand, previous encounters with the police and ethnicity did not have a significant effect. 
                                     Overall, it could be determined that international students have more confidence in the Swedish police than in the police of their home countries. 
                                     This relationship is complex and appears to vary greatly depending on the person’s background.</p>

                                <p class="summary">The aim of this research is to find out if there is a difference in the degree of trust towards the police between students from cultures with high Power Distance and students from cultures with low Power Distance. 
                                    Globalization has changed the world, intercultural skills are increasingly in demand in companies as well as in private life. 
                                    This is why many students are drawn to study abroad, in order to develop their intercultural skills. 
                                    As a base for this paper, primarily Gert Hofstede's Power Distance Index was used. The question is important, on the one hand, 
                                    because dealing with different cultures is increasingly important and, on the other hand, because trust in the police is an important prerequisite for police performance
                                     and efficiency. In order to find an answer to the question, a quantitative survey was conducted. A total of 104 international students in Sweden participated in the survey. 
                                     The results showed that there is little evidence suggesting that coming from a country with a high or low power distance has an effect on trust in the police.
                                      Moreover, it could be found that women on average have more trust in the police and that there is a complex relationship between ethnicity and trust in the police. 
                                      Thus, continuous intercultural training is recommended.</p>

                                <p class="summary">Code-switching is a term used to describe a 
                                    behavior where a discourse participant switches between two or more languages. 
                                    Although code-switching can be used in written text, there is little research on its use outside of spoken discourse. 
                                    This study explores how English code-switching is currently used in Swedish print advertising. 
                                    Furthermore, the study uses theoretical models to categorize different types of code-switching to see which ones are used most frequently. 
                                    Code-switching is commonly used only informally between two or more discourse participants, but this study tries to assess how it might be applied by 
                                    copywriters to affect consumer persuasion. The results confirm previous studies in demonstrating that English is used considerably in Swedish advertising. 
                                    However, it also highlights how English usage can vary greatly depending on advertisement layout and sentence construction.</p>
